- Test file for variable validation functionality

- Valid variables with correct values
CalculationMode = gs
MixingScheme = broyden
Mixing = 0.3
MaximumIter = 100
ConvRelDens = 1e-6
BoxShape = sphere
XCFunctional = lda_x + lda_c_pz_mod
UnitsOutput = eV_Angstrom

- Invalid variable names (should show errors)
InvalidVariable = test
CalculationMod = gs
MixingSchem = broyden

- Invalid values for known variables (should show errors)
CalculationMode = invalid_mode
MixingScheme = invalid_scheme
Mixing = not_a_number
MaximumIter = 10.5
BoxShape = invalid_shape
XCFunctional = invalid_functional + another_invalid

- Logical variable tests
MixingPreconditioner = true
MixingPreconditioner = false
MixingPreconditioner = invalid_logical

- String variables (usually valid)
UnitsOutput = eV_Angstrom
UnitsOutput = "eV_Angstrom"

- Only lines starting with dash are comments
- This is a proper comment line
CalculationMode = gs
- Another comment line  
MixingScheme = broyden

- Block definitions should be ignored
